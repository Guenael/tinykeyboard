 * This constant define not debouncing time in msecs, but amount of matrix
 * scan loops which should be made to get stable debounced results.
 *
 * On Ergodox matrix scan rate is relatively low, because of slow I2C.
 * Now it's only 317 scans/second, or about 3.15 msec/scan.
 * According to Cherry specs, debouncing time is 5 msec.
 *
 * And so, there is no sense to have DEBOUNCE higher than 2.
